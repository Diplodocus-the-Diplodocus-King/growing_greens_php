# growing_greens_php
PHP learning example website

Basic website showing use of the PHP language along with templating, form validation, CRUD database operations, MySQL use and navigation.

The site was built using the Xampp stack package. For the purpose of cloning this repo the files should be placed in a folder within the htdocs/ folder 
within the xampp application folder (try C:\xampp\htdocs). 

The sql folder should be removed and the sub folder placed in the /xampp/mysql/data/ folder. Note the database uses a password protected user to access it where the config 
file has not been uploaded to this repo, you'll need to create your own user for database access and update line 6 in the db_connect.php file located in the config folder.
